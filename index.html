        Six Flags Fiesta Texas is a theme park near me, and has the roller
        coasters Goliath and Iron Rattler. Six Flags Fiesta Texas also has a
        water park and many family rides. Six Flags Fiesta Texas is part of the
        large chain of theme parks, Six Flags.

        Aeroguard Flight School is a flights school in Georgetown TX. It is the
        flight school I hope to attend after going to college and is not really
        a tourist destination, but something I want to one day attend. It
        provides all materials you will need for a set cost and after
        graduation, you are guarunteed an interview with Delta's regional
        carrier, SkyWest.

        The SpaceX Boca Chica site is a launch pad on the America-Mexico border
        that SpaceX plans to use for Starship Superheavy going to the moon and
        mars. I want to see this site both to watch takeoffs and landings and to
        see how construction is going on it right now.

        This is where Boeing makes all of its planes, and even has its own
        runway. I want to go on a tour and possibly watch a 787 Dreamliner,
        their latest plane, be assembled.

        As the name suggests, Sunshine Village is a ski resort in Canada. I
        don't particularly want to go there, I just searched "ski resorts" and
        it was one of the first ones to pop up. It is also at the highest
        elevation for a Canadian ski resort.

        Embraer is a South American company that makes small business and
        commercial jets. They have several lines and their largest is the
        Embraer E Series, which is their only series of planes that has wing
        mounted engines.

        Beijing Daxing Airport is Beijing's new large international hub. It has
        80 gates, 4 runways, and 5 concourses. It is shaped like a 6 pointed
        star and is very aestetically pleasing. It has 6 mega-columns at the
        start of each concourse and where the check in area ends.

        Titan is one of the largest moons in the solar system. It is possible
        that Titan could support life, because it has water. It is one of
        Saturn's moons and the most prominent feature of Titan is its hazy
        atmosphere. The atmosphere is mostly composed of nitrogen, with methane
        and ethane clouds.
